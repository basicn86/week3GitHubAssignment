This program calculates shipping costs to four different countries (US, Canada, Australia, and Russia) and displays to the user how much it will cost to ship an item of X amount of value to a specific country. It will also include shipping costs if the item is fragile. The program will also print a receipt (in order.txt) that contains the name of the item being shipping, the shipping cost, the destination it is being shipped to, and the total cost of shipping.
